    "### Arguments for Initialising GrainBoundaryGenerator\n",
    "#### `bulk_0: Structure`\n",
    "This this the bulk cell to be analysed for finding the conventional and primitive cell. \n",
    "Unless this is the conventional cell a warning will be shown displaying the conventional cell that was found. \n",
    "#### `miller_0: ArrayLike`\n",
    "This is the miller index of the `Grain` and is relative to the conventional cell found by the symmetry analyser.\n",
    "#### `bulk_1: Optional[Structure] = None`\n",
    "An optional second `Structure` can be passed as the bulk cell to be used for the second grain. \n",
    "This is useful for creating interfaces between materials.\n",
    "**Currently there is no checking for commensurate lattices.**\n",
    "Lattices will be made as orthogonal as possible without increasing the number of atoms in the oriented unit cell.\n",
    "Further matching must be done by the user.\n",
    "The second `Grain` is scaled such that its a and b fractional are the same in the first `Grain`'s lattice whilst maintaining its own spacing in the Cartesian z-direction.\n",
    "#### `miller_1: Optional[ArrayLike] = None`\n",
    "An optional second index can be supplied for the second `Grain`.\n",
    "This is useful for creating aymmetric `GrainBoundries`.\n",
    "Like with the optional second bulk `Structure` there is no lattice matching attempted and the user is responsible for making the lattices commensurate.\n",
    "#### `mirror_x: bool = False`\n",
    "The second `Grain` can be mirrored along any of the 3 Cartesian directions, this flag will mirror it along the x-direction if set to `True`.\n",
    "#### `mirror_y: bool = False`\n",
    "The second `Grain` can be mirrored along any of the 3 Cartesian directions, this flag will mirror it along the y-direction if set to `True`.\n",
    "#### `mirror_z: bool = False`\n",
    "The second `Grain` can be mirrored along any of the 3 Cartesian directions, this flag will mirror it along the z-direction if set to `True`. \n",
    "This is most commonly used for creating twinned `GrainBoundaries`.\n",
    "#### `vacuum: Optional[float] = None`\n",
    "Incases where the `Grains` are asymmetric the `GrainBoundaries` can have two disinct interfaces, in this case a vacuum gap can be inserted between them so that the there is only one interface and two surfaces.\n",
    "When no vacuum is supplied the z-component of the `translation_vec` is used to seperate both interfaces.\n",
    "#### `translation_vec: ArrayLike = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`\n",
    "This vector is applied to the second `Grain` to shift it relative to the first. \n",
    "It is in Cartesian coordinates and has the unit Angstrom.\n",
    "#### `merge_tol: Optional[float] = None`\n",
    "An optional tolerance, in Angstrom, for merging atoms at the boundary together.\n",
    "If used this will often raise a warning as the site properties of the merged atoms will be removed if they are different. \n",
    "This is okay to ignore. \n",
    "#### `reconstruction: Optional[Callable[[\"Grain\", Site], bool]] = None`\n",
    "An optional function that excepts a `Grain` and `Site` and returns a `True` or `False` value on whether that site should be included in the structure.\n",

    "An optional dictionary describing maximum bond lengths between pairs of atoms. \n",

    "#### `repair: bool = False`\n",
    "If the [max_broken_bonds](#max_broken_bonds:-int-=-0) is violated then should we attempt to repair the surface.\n",
    "#### `symmetrize: bool = False`\n",
    "A flag on whether only symmetric `Grain` terminations should be considered.\n",
    "If the `Grain` is asymmetric then we should try and make it symmetric by removing atoms from the surface, this results in a non-stoichiometric `Grain`.\n",
    "If symmetric and stoichiometric `Grains` are required then the `GrainBoundaryGenerator` can be filtered to exclude the `Grains` with the property `symmetrize = True`.\n",

    "There are three ways to set the thickness of the `Grains` in the `GrainBoundary` and only one is considered.\n",
